Hi! I'm Bonnie, an incoming master's student at MIT studying operations research engineering. I'm graduating from {{< staticref "https://www.cornell.edu/" "newtab" >}}Cornell University{{< /staticref >}} in May 2022 with a degree in both computer science and operations research, and I'm very interested in the intersection of mathematics, computing, and social good. I currently work with professors {{< staticref "https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/" "newtab" >}}Peter Frazier{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shane/" "newtab" >}}Shane Henderson{{< /staticref >}}, and {{< staticref "https://www.orie.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/david-b-shmoys" "newtab" >}}David Shmoys{{< /staticref >}} on the {{< staticref "https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/modeling/" "newtab" >}}Cornell COVID-19 Modeling Team{{< /staticref >}}, where we analyze campus data to help guide administrative decisions. 

I've previously interned for various organizations, including {{< staticref "https://aero.umd.edu/" "newtab" >}}University of Maryland Aerospace Engineering{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://www.vonage.com/" "newtab" >}}Vonage{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://www.bandwidth.com/" "newtab" >}}Bandwidth{{< /staticref >}}, and {{< staticref "https://www.goldmansachs.com/" "newtab" >}}Goldman Sachs{{< /staticref >}}. I'll be returning to Goldman Sachs this upcoming summer as a Quantitative Strategy Summer Analyst.
