Hi! I'm Bonnie, an incoming master's student at MIT studying operations researchengineering. I'm graduating from Cornell University in May 2022 with a degree in both computer science and operations research, and I'm very interested in the intersection of mathematics, computing, and social good. I currently work with professors {{< staticref "https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/" "newtab" >}}Peter Frazier{{< /staticref >}}, Shane Henderson, and David Shomys on the Cornell COVID-19 Modeling Team, where we analyze campus data to help guide administrative decisions.
